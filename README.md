I'm def213. I do some projects in Python and sometimes write in other languages (I’m still learning). I studied Python with the team, but now I delve deep into it on my own, sometimes I present my projects to my team and they appreciate my project. What can I write in Python: A project dedicated to my favorite game Galaxian, which was released on the Atari 2600, should be released this week. I want to release it on the platform. The next project will be ports from different consoles such as nes or atari because they are the easiest to port, but starting from 16 bit consoles I’ll probably make a site in Python with stories and maybe even on this site you can play old games like races on snes or sega mega drive. So far these are all my plans for this year. I will be glad if you read this README.md.
